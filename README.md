# TF2Center AdBlock

Extension for the Blink-based browsers (tested in **Chromium** and **Chrome**, but may work in *Brave*, *Vivaldi*, *Opera*, *Yandex Browser*, etc.)

Extension is blocking ads on the lobbies page without triggering anti-adblocker.

It will take this page:
![Not a Futurama reference](https://lut.im/E4sPNp95sd/HPvZabMYjtG7Yajq.JPG "Not a Futurama reference")

And remove all the advertisement garbage:
![Clean](https://lut.im/b9yAqsegti/0rwG3eMxbVMjtcsM.JPG "Clean")
