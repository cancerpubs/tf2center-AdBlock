# TF2Center AdBlock

Extension for the Blink-based browsers (tested in **Chromium**, **Chrome**, **FireFox** and **Opera**, but may work in *Brave*, *Vivaldi*, *Yandex Browser*, etc.)

Extension is blocking ads on the lobbies page without triggering anti-adblocker.

It will take this page:
![Not a Futurama reference](https://lut.im/E4sPNp95sd/HPvZabMYjtG7Yajq.JPG "Not a Futurama reference")

And remove all the advertisement garbage:
![Clean](https://lut.im/b9yAqsegti/0rwG3eMxbVMjtcsM.JPG "Clean")

## Installation

select your browser:

## Manual installation

Download and unzip the archive.

Open your browser and in the dropdown menu click **Settings** and then on the side menu click **Extensions**.

Or from the dropdown menu go **More Tools > Extensions**.

In the Extensions menu click on the **Developer mode** checkbox and then click **Load unpacked extension...**.

Then navigate to the folder where you unpacked archive and select *tf2center AdBlock* folder.

If you did everything right, extension will appear in the Extensions menu. Make sure that **Enabled** checkbox is set.

If you have any other adblocking or privacy enhancing extensions - make sure that they are disabled for the TF2C's domain, because these extenisons still can trigger anti-adblocker.
